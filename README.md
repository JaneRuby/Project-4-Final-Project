# AskNeil: an app experience

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neildiamond.janerubygrissom.myapplication

AskNeil combines the IBM Watson Conversation API with original artwork and design to create a Neil Diamond-themed advice app. When opened, the app prompts the user to ask a Neil-bot something about love or music. Using cloud-based pre-programming through IBM's Watson service, the bot interprets the question through natural language processing and responds with a Neil Diamond-themed answer. The app displays one of several hand-drawn Neils with the answer, and the user can share the response on social media or return to the original prompt. The user can also view fun facts about Neil Diamond at the prompt screen.

The app updates an AskJeeves-like answering service with a kitsch design, providing a unique and memorably interactive user experience. Based on user reviews, most advice apps are difficult and uninteresting. AskNeil focuses on being fun and funny. So while the user will not get something of depth and substance out of the responses, they may smile or laugh, and share that experience with their friends or family. Beyond a humor-app, AskNeil also works as an art object, communicating artistic nuances to the user.

I built the AskNeil in Android Studio, using Picasso for the Neil illustrations, and the IBM Watson Conversation API for the Neil bot. IBM’s Watson technology uses natural language processing to build and train a bot. To simulate conversation with Neil Diamond, I define Watson inputs called intents and entities, and Watson outputs called dialogs. The Watson technology interprets the user input and sends it to my bot input, which then returns my bot output. For example, I might define an intent for “love”, which the technology might match if the user inputs “heart”; for this intent, I could associate an output from a Neil Diamond quote or lyric, which would return to user.

Why Neil Diamond? In the cult comedy What About Bob? (1991), Bill Murray’s character declares: “There are two types of people in this world: Those who like Neil Diamond, and those who don't.” From “I’m a Believer” to “Sweet Caroline”, he’s one of the most iconic songwriters artists of all time. More recently, his trendy and lowbrow kitsch appeal has turned him on to younger audiences, and I wanted to play up that concept to keep users engaged in a memorable app experience. And just as everyone remembers Jeeves from AskJeeves, I’m hoping to tap into Neil Diamond’s iconography to entice people into installing and sharing the app.

As an artist and a developer, I attempted to make sure the user feels artist’s hand in the app, while also following Material Design concepts. I built the color scheme around Neil Diamond’s wardrobe. The primary colors center on Neil’s iconic sapphire blue shirts. Since he’s also 1960s traditional, often in black suits, I used hand-drawn black and white illustrations to govern the secondary aesthetics. Based on user feedback from other advice apps, I also emphasized color consistency, simplicity, and splash screens throughout.

As the creator of the Neil Watson bot, I tried merging ideas from both my own experiences as a fan, as well as how I believe Neil Diamond himself would respond. There are endless ways to approach this intended communication program, which really pushed me to think about linguistics and Neil lore as much as programming. In the IBM Watson application, I created language prompt flow diagrams that charted the train of thought that I wanted my bot to have. Then I carefully crafted the bot’s answers to the specific language prompts. At this stage, time constraints limited the Neil bot’s knowledge, but the slow-growth technology gives the project long-term potential for continued app development.
